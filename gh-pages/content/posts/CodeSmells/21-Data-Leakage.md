### Description

#### Context
The data leakage occurs when the data used for training a machine learning model contains prediction result information.

#### Problem
Data leakage frequently leads to overly optimistic experimental outcomes and poor performance in real-world usage.

#### Solution
There are two main sources of data leakage: leaky predictors and a leaky validation strategy. Leaky predictors are the cases in which some features used in training are modified or generated after the goal value has been achieved. This kind of data leakage can only be inspected at the data level rather than the code level. Leaky validation strategy refers to the scenario where training data is mixed with validation data. This fault can be checked at the code level. One best practice in Scikit-Learn is to use the `Pipeline()` API to prevent data leakage.

### Type

Generic

### Existing Stage

Model Evaluation

### Effect

Error-prone

### Example

```diff
### Scikit-Learn
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np
+ from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

n_samples, n_features, n_classes = 200, 10000, 2
rng = np.random.RandomState(42)
X = rng.standard_normal((n_samples, n_features))
y = rng.choice(n_classes, n_samples)

- X_selected = SelectKBest(k=25).fit_transform(X, y)
- X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_selected, y, random_state=42)
- gbc = GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=1)
- gbc.fit(X_train, y_train)
- y_pred = gbc.predict(X_test)
+ X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=42)
+ pipeline = make_pipeline(SelectKBest(k=25), GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=1))
+ pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
+ y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)

accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
```
