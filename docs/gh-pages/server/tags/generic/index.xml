      <title>Randomness Uncontrolled</title>

      <description>Description Debugging is easier if the results are reproducible when developing ML systems. Also, reproducibility helps conduct studies based on previous models. Setting random seeds significantly contributes to the reproducibility of ML applications. There are several scenes that a random seed is involved. In Scikit-Learn, randomness is inherently involved in some estimators(e.g., Random Forest) and cross-validation splitters. If the random seed is not set, the random forest algorithm might provide a different result every time it runs, and the dataset split by cross-validation splitter will also be different next time it runs.</description>

      <title>In Place APIs Misused</title>
      <link>https://hynn01.github.io/dslinter/code-smells/in-place-apis-misused/</link>

      <description>Description “In-place operation is an operation that directly changes the content of a given linear algebra, vector, matrices (Tensor) without making a copy.” Due to the nature of the in-place operation, the in-place APIs are easily misused. Developers sometimes forget to set the in-place parameter in APIs to true while not assigning the new result to a variable, causing potential silent bugs. The data is not updated in this way, but the developer thinks it is and might not be able to find where the bug is.</description>

      <description>Description &amp;ldquo;Vectorization is the process of converting an algorithm from operating on a single value at a time to operating on a set of values (vector) at one time.&amp;rdquo; ML applications are often data-intensive and need to apply an operation on a dataset. Therefore, it is better to adopt vectorized solution instead of iterating over data. As stated in the Pandas documentation : ”Iterating through pandas objects is generally slow. In many cases, iterating manually over the rows is not needed and can be avoided”.</description>

      <title>No Scaling Before Scaling-sensitive Operation</title>
      <link>https://hynn01.github.io/dslinter/code-smells/no-scaling-before-scaling-sensitive-operation/</link>

      <description>Description Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used for finding the components that maximize the data&amp;rsquo;s variation and reduce its dimensions, which is an essential data processing method. Scaling is pretty crucial to PCA because of the way the principal components are calculated. If one variable is on a larger scale than another, it will dominate the PCA procedure. Similarly, there are some other scaling-sensitive operations. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Multi-layer Perceptron classifier, L1 and L2 regularization are all sensitive to feature scaling.</description>

      <title>Data Leakage</title>
      <link>https://hynn01.github.io/dslinter/code-smells/data-leakage/</link>

      <guid>https://hynn01.github.io/dslinter/code-smells/data-leakage/</guid>
      <description>Description &amp;ldquo;Data Leakage happens when the data you are using to train a machine learning algorithm happens to have the information you are trying to predict.&amp;rdquo; It results in overly optimistic performance during testing and poor performance in real-world usage. There are two main sources of data leakage: leaky predictors and a leaky validation strategy. Leaky predictors refer to the situation where some features updated or created after the target value is realized are included.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter not Explicitly Set</title>
      <link>https://hynn01.github.io/dslinter/code-smells/hyperparameter-not-explicitly-set/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://hynn01.github.io/dslinter/code-smells/hyperparameter-not-explicitly-set/</guid>
      <description>Description Hyperparameters are ML algorithm parameters used to control the learning process and are usually determined before the actual process starts. Hyperparameters should be set and tuned because they improve prediction quality and reproducibility. Tuning hyperparameters can lead to higher prediction quality because the default parameters of the learning algorithm may not be optimal for a given data or problem, and may lead to local optima. These parameters directly control the behavior of the training algorithm and therefore have a significant impact on the performance of the model.</description>

      <title>Excessive Hyperparameter</title>
      <link>https://hynn01.github.io/dslinter/deprecated/excessive-hyperparameter/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://hynn01.github.io/dslinter/deprecated/excessive-hyperparameter/</guid>
      <description>Description Excessive hyperparameter precision is a potential risk for overtuning. Overtuning occurs if an overly high precision hyperparameter value allows the model to perform particularly well while values in close range of it do not. Further, the choice of such a hyperparameter might be uninterpretable to users, which leads to an untrustworthy result.

      <title>Counterintuitive Hyperparameter</title>

      <guid>https://hynn01.github.io/dslinter/deprecated/counterintuitive-hyperparameter/</guid>
      <description>Description Counterintuitive hyperparameters will also cause bugs. There are four posts on StackOverflow discussing where the bug in the program is, and it turns out that a large learning rate causes bugs. This implies that the developer should check whether the hyperparameters stay in the normal range when developing ML applications.

      <title>Memory not Freed</title>
      <link>https://hynn01.github.io/dslinter/code-smells/memory-not-freed/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://hynn01.github.io/dslinter/code-smells/memory-not-freed/</guid>
      <description>Description ML application training is memory-consuming, and thus, it is essential to free memory in time. Some APIs are provided to alleviate the run-out-of-memory issue in deep learning libraries. TensorFlow&amp;rsquo;s documentation notes that if the model is created in a loop, it is suggested to use clear\_session() in the loop. Meanwhile, the GitHub repository &amp;ldquo;Pytorch best practice&amp;rdquo; recommends using .detach() to detach the tensor whenever possible. We suggest developers check whether they use these APIs to free the memory whenever possible in their code.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Algorithm Not Used</title>
      <link>https://hynn01.github.io/dslinter/code-smells/deterministic-algorithm-not-used/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>Description Some libraries provide APIs for developers to use the deterministic algorithm. Using deterministic algorithms is another effort that can be made to improve reproducibility. In PyTorch, it is suggested to set torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True) when debugging. However, the application will perform slower if this option is set, so it is suggested not to use it in the deploy stage. Developers should be aware of this setting during the development process.

      <title>Missing the Mask of Invalid Value</title>

      <description>Description Several posts on Stack Overflow talk about the bugs that are not easy to discover caused by the log parameter approaching zero. In this kind of program, the log function variable turns to zero and raises an error during the training process. However, the error&amp;rsquo;s stack trace did not directly point to the line of code that the bug exist. This kind of problem is not easy to debug and might take a long training time to find.</description>

      <title>Initialize Weight to a Constant</title>

      <guid>https://hynn01.github.io/dslinter/deprecated/initialize-weight-to-zero/</guid>
      <description>Description In neural network, if all the weights are initialized to a constant, i.e., all the neurons starts with the same weight, all the neurons will follow the same gradient during the backward propagation update. As a result, neurons will learn same features in each iterations. In this way, the nueral netwok will provide a poor result.

      <title>Threshold Dependent Validation</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://hynn01.github.io/dslinter/code-smells/threshold-dependent-validation/</guid>
      <description>Description The performance of the machine learning model can be measured by different metrics, including threshold-dependent metrics(e.g., F-measure) or threshold-independent metrics(e.g., Area Under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)). Choosing a specific threshold is tricky and can lead to a less-interpretable result. Therefore, threshold-independent is more robust and should be preferred over threshold-independent metrics.
